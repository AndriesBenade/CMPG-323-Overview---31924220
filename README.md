## Use of .gitignore Files On Each Project Branch
.gitignore files will be used to exclude any additional, yet unnecesary files from the picture as a whole.
## Storage of Credentials and Sensitive Information
Credentials and sensitive information would have to be stored securely in order to prevent the information from getting leaked or from falling into the wrong hands.

# Project 1
## Link
https://github.com/AndriesBenade/CMPG-323-Overview---31924220.git
## About
This project is about setting up an overview repository that contains information like deadlines, tasks and goals.
## What I did
In this project I started out by creating and setting up the overview repository (which is also this current repository). Next I created the project within the repository that contains deadlines, issues, etc. After creating the project, I populated it with relevant data and information.
## How it went
This project went fairly well and I had a clear understanding of exactly what to do. I did not really struggle with anything, but I did, however find the data capturing to be extremely tedious.

# Project 2
## Link
https://github.com/AndriesBenade/CMPG-323-Project-2---31924220.git
## About
This project is about setting up, creating and working with your own API. It also requires me to be able to use and work with Microsoft Azure in order to publish and host certain elements of the project.
## What I did
In this project I started out by creating the repository for Project 2 and setting it up according to the requirments provided to us. Afterwards, I created a project/solution in Visual Studio to serve as the API that I would be working with. Next I created and setup the SQL server as well as the SQL database on Microsoft Azure right after creating a new Microsoft Azure account and linking it with my NWU student account. Next I attempted to publish the API to Microsoft Azure, but I did however have trouble doing this as the required option did not show up.
## How it went
This project did not go very well as I had a lot of trouble understanding what exactly was being expected from us. I did however manage to use and work with Microsoft Azure, but I had trouble working with and creating an API. There is definitely a lot of room for personal improvement in this field for me personally.

# Project 3
## Link
https://github.com/AndriesBenade/CMPG-323-Project-3---31924220.git
## About
This project is about working with web apps, repositories, using injections and working with a database as well as creating an app service to publish a web app. The project requires me to be able to work with web apps, Microsoft Azure, injections, GitHub, repositories, as well as controllers.
## What I did
In this project I started by creating a repository for Project 3. After that, I forked the required repository that contained the data I needed to work with and I created a development branch on the forked repository which is the branch I worked on. I then cloned the development branch to my PC and started working on the web app by creating an appsettings.json file and adding required information like the database's connection string (incorrect database connection string) to it. After doing that I used Microsoft Azure to create a new resource group for Project 3 and I proceeded to unknowingly create a new SQL server and -database which I then linked to my web app and then I published the web app for the first time. I noticed that the database did not function correctly and I then realised that I needed to use a provided connection string. After realising that, I deleted the SQL server and -database and replaced the wrong connection string in the appsettings.json file with the correct one. I published the web app again and saw that the database was now connected to the web app. I the proceeded to add tier 1 repository class implementations to my project which I later discarded in order to add tier 2 repository class implementation. After completing the repository classes, I transferred the data access operations to the repository classes and implemented the repository classes into the controller classes. After a final publish, I concluded that my project was completed successfully.
## How it went
This project went fairly well in my opinion. When I started, I had no idea what I was doing, but as I continued to push through, I understood more and knew what to do. All in all, this was a good project.
