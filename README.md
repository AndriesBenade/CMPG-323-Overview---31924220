# Project Repositories/Branches
Instead of creating a repository for each project, I will be creating a branch for each project within this current repository in order to keep all of my work neatly organized and in one place.

# Branching Strategies For Each Project
Each project will have its own branch within this repository and depending on what is asked/required of the projects, they might also have branches on their branches.

# Use of .gitignore Files On Each Project Branch
.gitignore files will be used to exclude any additional, yet unnecesary files from the picture as a whole.

# Storage of Credentials and Sensitive Information
Credentials and sensitive information would have to be stored securely in order to prevent the information from getting leaked or from falling into the wrong hands.

# Project 1
# -> About
This project is about setting up an overview repository that contains information like deadlines, tasks and goals.
# -> What I did
In this project I started out by creating and setting up the overview repository (which is also this current repository). Next I created the project within the repository that contains deadlines, issues, etc. After creating the project, I populated it with relevant data and information.
# -> How it went
This project went fairly well and I had a clear understanding of exactly what to do. I did not really struggle with anything, but I did, however find the data capturing to be extremely tedious.
